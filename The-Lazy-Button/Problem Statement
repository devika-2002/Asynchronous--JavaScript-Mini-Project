Problem Statement
You’re designing a webpage with a special button called “The Lazy Button.”

This button doesn’t like doing things immediately — it takes its time to respond.

When the user clicks it, the button should show that it’s thinking, 
then later confirm that it’s done, and finally reset itself to normal again — all automatically.

Your Task
Create a webpage that behaves as follows:

The page has one button with the text "Click Me!"
When clicked:
Immediately change the text to "Processing..."
Disable the button (so it can’t be clicked again yet).
After 2 seconds, automatically change the text to "Done!"
After another 1 second, reset:
Button text back to "Click Me!"
Button re-enabled for clicking again.
If the user tries clicking while it’s disabled, nothing should happen.
