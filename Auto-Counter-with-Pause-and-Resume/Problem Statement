Problem Statement
You’re building a webpage that displays a simple counter with Start, Pause, Resume, and Reset controls.

When started, the counter increases by 1 every second, showing the current number on screen.

Users can pause, resume, or reset the counter at any time.

Your Task
Create a webpage that behaves exactly as described below:

The page should display a counter starting at 0.
Include three buttons: Start, Pause, and Reset. The Pause button will later change to Resume when needed.
On clicking Start:
Begin counting up by +1 every second using setInterval().
Disable the Start button so it cannot be clicked again while counting.
Enable the Pause button.
On clicking Pause:
Stop the counter by using clearInterval().
Change the Pause button text to Resume.
On clicking Resume:
Continue counting up from the current value using setInterval().
Change the Resume button text back to Pause.
On clicking Reset:
Stop any ongoing counting.
Set the counter back to 0.
Reset all buttons to their original states.
Ensure that only one interval is ever active at a time.
Think Before You Code
Before writing any code, take time to plan your solution in depth. 
Break the requirements into smaller steps — decide what needs to happen first, 
what follows, and how each part will connect. Once you have your plan, start implementing each step one by one.
