The game displays a 3x3 grid (9 boxes total). Every few seconds, one box becomes active by changing color.
The player must click it before it deactivates to score a point.

Your Task
Create a webpage that behaves as follows:

The page displays a 3x3 grid of gray boxes.
Every 2 seconds, one random box becomes active by changing its color from gray to green.
The player has 1 second to click the active box.
If the player clicks the active box → +1 point.
After a 2-second gap, another random box becomes active.
The game runs for 30 seconds in total.
When the game ends:
All boxes deactivate.
The final score remains displayed on the screen.
Think Before You Code
Before writing any code, take time to plan your solution in depth. 
Break the requirements into smaller steps — decide what needs to happen first, what follows, 
and how each part will connect. Once you have your plan, start implementing each step one by one.
